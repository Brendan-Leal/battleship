----------------------Understand the Problem----------------------- 
THINGS TO CONSIDER: 
-If any part of the problem is unclear, ask for clarification. -Do I
need to return the same object or an entirely new one?

PROBLEM STATEMENT: Return a coordinate based on the highes probability that a ship is in a given set of cells
work out all possible locations that every ship could fit (horizontally or vertically).

IF the ship length occupies 6 cells then 

EXPECTED INPUT: map object

EXPECTED OUTPUT: string (coordinate)
